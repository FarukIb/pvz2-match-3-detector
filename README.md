note: this doesnt attempt to find out what each plant actually is it just uses a combination of hu moments and the RGB vectors of the plants to figure out which plants differ from each other

if someone wants to use this you probably need to first enable usb debugging on your phone, configure the resolution of the screen in the script to match yours (width, height variables), adjust the the corners of the grid (x1,y1, x2, y2).

blue lines mean that the swap is math >3, red swaps are swaps of 3

it doesnt work the best, it would probably work better if you made a change to ignore any cells for which the code mistakenly classified >2 plants in a row on the grid
